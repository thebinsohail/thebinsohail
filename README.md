I am a Full-Stack Developer having good knowledge of front-end and back-end techniques for building web applications that match client needs.

I have developed several web applications from scratch but at the same time, I manage and update the client's existing projects also as I have outstanding debugging skills. I also do Web-Scraping and Automation.
